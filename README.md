## General Info
The code, here, is written in the course of working through some *algorithm solutions*.
 
## Technologies Used
The code will be written in Typescript and tested using JestJS.

## Usage
The code from the various sections of the project will be largely executed through the testing of the code to ensure that a correct solution has been found.
```
   npm test
```
  
## Project Status
The project will be in an ongoing status until the code for each section is completed and the solutions for the algorithms have been completed as well.
    
## Room for Improvement
Similarly to the above section of this document, there can be seen a general room for improvement as the greater project associated with this project is a learning project.
